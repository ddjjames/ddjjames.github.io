                This project was created to explore the aspects of 3D-level design with no real game as an end goal I 
                had made a few games as a programmer before but for this, I focused from a designer's perspective. 
                The question I asked myself was "What is needed from me so that the other disciplines can turn my 
                prototype into a reality". The areas I identified that were most important were; whiteboxing, 2D sketches,
                scripting, and lighting. At each iteration of the prototype, I asked myself whether enough existed to
                convey a clear message of what I was trying to create.

                Before starting I needed a theme to work off of after brainstorming for a few "king" came to mind.
                So I selected a medieval theme where you are a General in a war and your army is vastly
                outnumber so you taken upon yourself to make your way behind enemy lines 
                to the king's castle undetected.

        <p class = "project__description--para"> 
            I started by sketching the primary engagement areas of my level
            (Setup, Hook, Development Phases, Resolution). Each of these arcs 
            elicits a different feeling from the player.
            Going from the setup phase to the hook sets the tone and gives the player an idea of what is going on story-wise,
            from the development to the turn the anticipation builds as the sight of the resolution nears.
            
            Once completed I started to fill in the gaps between these areas in my sketch by adding the appropriate 
            spatial archetypes in them.

            When my 2D sketch was complete it was time to translate that into a Unity project.
            I used Unity's terrain tools to get my starting landscape; To sculpt mountains
            I used the ProBuilder extension to build simple structures with the 3D shapes provided,
            for more complex structures like the king's castle I made edits to simple shapes.

        <h1>Scripting</h1>
        <div class="project__divider"> </div>
        <p class = "project__description--para"> 
            There was minimal scripting done for this prototype, I scripted an AI to patrol a given
            path. If the player was caught along the path they would respawn at the most recent checkpoint. 
            Once the player was seen it wasn't an auto loss, 
            they were given a few seconds to get out of the patrol's line of sight depicted by a cone of light.
            I also programmed the opposing army to kill the player if they ventured too close to 
            the battlefield along with some other movement scripts.
            <br>
            I scripted a cutscene system. Which activated when the player got near  
            points of interest the player controller deactivated and the camera would pan to the point where they should be
            looking. This is similar to the The Last of Us hint system. I also used these cutscene areas as checkpoints.

            The Lighting used in the level was added to accomplish two goals, guide the player and point out important
            points of interest like the castle & secret entrances. I used Unity's particle system to create effects players would not miss and placed torches
            along the main path so players would know if there on the right track.
